SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ESTABLISHING CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVENANCE AND CONTINUITY OF DIGITAL ARTIFACTS REPRESENTING COGNITIVE EVENTS
 CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application titled “SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ESTABLISHING PROVABLE ORIGINATION AND TEMPORAL CONTINUITY OF HUMAN THOUGHT USING CRYPTOGRAPHIC CUSTODIAL CHAINS,” filed on or about January 2026, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present disclosure relates to cryptographic recordkeeping, evidentiary custody systems, authorship verification, and legal-grade provenance. More particularly, it relates to systems and methods for cryptographically sealing, timestamping, chaining, anchoring, and custodially preserving human-originated cognitive artifacts (“Thoughts”) to establish provable origination, temporal priority, continuity of ideation, and evidentiary integrity without requiring public disclosure.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION


Conventional mechanisms for establishing authorship, invention priority, and provenance rely on publication platforms, patent offices, notaries, institutional trust, or centralized digital services. These mechanisms are slow, jurisdiction-bound, disclosure-forcing, and increasingly ineffective in the presence of generative systems capable of producing synthetic artifacts at scale. File timestamps can be manipulated, custody can be disputed, and perfect duplication destroys evidentiary scarcity.
More fundamentally, modern computing systems (including conventional file systems, collaboration platforms, registries, and timestamping services) do not implement a cryptographically governed object type or custody protocol that 
(i) deterministically canonicalizes a digital artifact explicitly attributed to a declared human author via cryptographic credentials, with cryptographically verifiable authorship into stable bytes, 
(ii) binds the artifact to cryptographic identifiers and trusted temporal attestations, 
(iii) preserves the artifact within an immutable custody bundle under author-controlled disclosure, and 
(iv) supports cryptographic chaining and optional public or consortium anchoring to provide tamper-evident origination and continuity. In addition, as generative systems increasingly produce synthetic bitstreams at scale, mere possession of a digital artifact or a platform timestamp no longer provides reliable evidence of human origination, priority, or integrity.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention provides systems, methods, and computer-readable media implementing a cryptographically governed object type and custody protocol for digital records of human cognitive artifacts, comprising Genesis records, append-only chained Thought records, deterministic canonicalization, cryptographic hashing, timestamp attestation, custodial storage, optional multi-custodian redundancy, public or consortium ledger anchoring, selective disclosure controls, deterministic restoration, and evidentiary certificate generation.
In exemplary embodiments, the system enables provable establishment of origination, temporal priority, custody, and lineage of digital records of human cognitive artifacts independent of publication, patent filing, or institutional trust. Embodiments further support trade-secret continuity, research provenance, creative authorship verification, long-horizon legacy chains, jurisdiction-specific evidentiary packaging, and declared provenance classification (e.g., human-originated, assisted, mixed, machine-generated, or unknown) for evidentiary clarity.

Overview of Operation. In exemplary embodiments, an author submits an original Thought transformed into a digital record of a human cognitive artifact to a processing system. The system operates exclusively on digital records and cryptographic metadata, and does not evaluate, judge, or interpret the underlying cognitive content beyond deterministic transformation and verification. The processing system canonicalizes the submitted artifact to a deterministic byte representation, generates a cryptographic hash identifier, binds one or more trusted timestamp attestations to the identifier, creates a custody bundle, and stores the custody bundle in an immutable custodial storage system. The system issues a cryptographic receipt to the author evidencing successful sealing.
The author may submit subsequent Thoughts to extend the chain. Each subsequent Thought incorporates at least one predecessor identifier and its own timestamp attestation into cryptographic computation, thereby enforcing append-only chaining and proving irreversible chronological continuity on a machine-enforced basis. Optionally, cryptographic representations of custody bundles are programmatically anchored by the processing system to one or more public or consortium ledgers for independent temporal verification. Verification of existence, priority, and continuity may be performed without disclosure of underlying content.
Cryptographic Architecture: Canonicalization and Cryptographic Sealing. Canonicalization transforms a submitted Thought into a deterministic byte sequence that is stable across encoding differences, formatting changes, metadata ordering, line endings, containerization, compression headers, and platform variations. The canonicalization process is configured such that semantically identical content produces identical canonical bytes, while any semantic or bitlevel difference produces a distinct canonical representation.
A cryptographic hash is computed over the canonical bytes to generate an immutable content identifier. The hash function may comprise a secure oneway function selected to exhibit collision resistance and an avalanche property, such that any bitlevel alteration of the canonical bytes produces a materially different identifier. This property renders tampering, substitution, truncation, or reencoding of sealed Thoughts cryptographically detectable.
In exemplary embodiments, the canonical byte representation and resulting hash identifier are treated as authoritative for all subsequent custody, chaining, timestamping, anchoring, and verification operations. No downstream operation alters the canonical bytes after sealing.
In certain implementations, a user interface renders a cryptographicallyderived visualization or summary prior to final sealing to provide transparency into the canonicalization and hashing event, without exposing or modifying the canonical byte sequence itself.
In certain implementations, the user interface renders a cryptographicallyderived visualization prior to final sealing to provide transparency into the canonicalization and hashing event.
Illustrative Canonicalization Example (Non-Limiting). To clarify the role of canonicalization prior to cryptographic sealing, the following simplified example is provided. This example is non-limiting and is intended to illustrate deterministic normalization of semantically identical content that would otherwise hash differently due to incidental representation differences.
Example Thought (intended semantic content):
In practice, the same semantic content may be represented by different byte sequences depending on software, platform, or storage conditions.
Input A (non-canonical form): UTF-8 text including a byte order mark (BOM), Windows-style CRLF line ending, and trailing spaces.
Textual view:
Inventive note: Use graphene membrane for front projection film.  
Representative byte sequence (hexadecimal, non-exhaustive): EF BB BF 49 6E 76 65 6E 74 69 76 65 20 6E 6F 74 65 3A 20 55 73 65 20 67 72 61 70 68 65 6E 65 20 6D 65 6D 62 72 61 6E 65 20 66 6F 72 20 66 72 6F 6E 74 20 70 72 6F 6A 65 63 74 69 6F 6E 20 66 69 6C 6D 2E 20 20 0D 0A Input B (non-canonical form): UTF-8 text with no BOM, Unix-style LF line ending, and no trailing spaces.
Textual view:
Inventive note: Use graphene membrane for front projection film.
Representative byte sequence (hexadecimal, non-exhaustive): 49 6E 76 65 6E 74 69 76 65 20 6E 6F 74 65 3A 20 55 73 65 20 67 72 61 70 68 65 6E 65 20 6D 65 6D 62 72 61 6E 65 20 66 6F 72 20 66 72 6F 6E 74 20 70 72 6F 6A 65 63 74 69 6F 6E 20 66 69 6C 6D 2E 0A
Although Input A and Input B are semantically identical to a human reader, they are not byte-identical and would ordinarily produce different cryptographic hash outputs if hashed directly.
In exemplary embodiments, the system applies a deterministic canonicalization function prior to hashing. Canonicalization may include, without limitation:
	1.	Removal of non-semantic encoding markers (e.g., UTF-8 BOM).
	2.	Normalization of line endings to a canonical form (e.g., LF).
	3.	Removal of trailing whitespace where not semantically meaningful.
	4.	Normalization of structural ordering and container metadata where applicable.
After canonicalization, both Input A and Input B yield the same canonical byte sequence.
Canonical form (textual view): Inventive note: Use graphene membrane for front projection film.
Canonical byte sequence (hexadecimal): 49 6E 76 65 6E 74 69 76 65 20 6E 6F 74 65 3A 20 55 73 65 20 67 72 61 70 68 65 6E 65 20 6D 65 6D 62 72 61 6E 65 20 66 6F 72 20 66 72 6F 6E 74 20 70 72 6F 6A 65 63 74 69 6F 6E 20 66 69 6C 6D 2E 0A
 The cryptographic identifier is computed exclusively over the canonical byte sequence (and, in certain embodiments, cryptographically bound timestamp attestation data). As a result, both non-canonical inputs produce the same identifier, while any substantive modification to the content produces a different canonical byte sequence and therefore a different identifier.
This example demonstrates that cryptographic sealing reflects the substance of the digital record rather than incidental differences in formatting, encoding, or storage representation, enabling reliable provenance, priority, and continuity verification.
Timestamp Attestation and Temporal Priority: In exemplary embodiments, a trusted timestamp attestation is obtained and cryptographically bound to the hash identifier of each sealed Thought to establish temporal priority. The binding operation associates the hash identifier with one or more verifiable time values such that the timestamp cannot be altered, removed, or reassigned without invalidating the identifier.
Timestamp attestations may be obtained from one or more independent time sources, including without limitation trusted timestamping authorities, public time services, consortiumoperated services, secure time beacons, or other verifiable temporal anchors. Multiple independent attestations may be obtained for a single Thought to improve resilience against singlesource failure, compromise, or dispute.
Each timestamp attestation is incorporated into the custody bundle and, where applicable, into cryptographic material used for successor chaining. By binding timestamps directly to canonicalized content identifiers, the system prevents posthoc backdating, reordering, or substitution of sealed Thoughts. Any modification to the canonicalized content, hash identifier, or associated timestamp produces a different cryptographic result that is detectable during verification.
The timestamp attestation mechanism therefore provides a machineenforced basis for temporal priority that is independent of filesystem timestamps, platform clocks, or institutional recordkeeping.
AppendOnly Chaining and Continuity: Subsequent Thoughts extend an existing Thought Chain by incorporating a cryptographic reference to a predecessor Thought (including, without limitation, a predecessor hash value, chain identifier, or other derived commitment) into the successor Thought’s hash computation. As a result, each successor Thought is mathematically bound to the exact state of its predecessor at the time of sealing.
Because secure cryptographic hash functions exhibit an avalanche effect in which a single-bit change to an input produces a substantially different output, any alteration, omission, or substitution of a predecessor Thought invalidates the cryptographic identifiers of all successor Thoughts. This property renders the chain append-only and enforces irreversible chronological continuity on a machine-enforced basis.
In exemplary embodiments, Thought Chains may be linear or may branch to represent divergent ideation paths originating from a common predecessor Thought. Branching preserves full cryptographic lineage to the shared origin while allowing independent evolution of parallel cognitive developments.
The chain records continuity of ideation rather than intellectual hierarchy. A successor Thought may represent a minor revision, an intermediate exploration, or a substantial conceptual or inventive breakthrough, while remaining cryptographically anchored to its antecedents.
Custodial Storage, Neutrality, and Auditability: Custody Bundles are stored in an immutable custodial storage system configured to prevent alteration, removal, substitution, or retroactive rewriting after sealing. In exemplary embodiments, immutability is enforced through cryptographic integrity verification, write-once or append-only storage semantics, and tamper-detection mechanisms that invalidate custody proofs upon unauthorized modification.
Custodial Authorities operate under protocol-enforced neutrality constraints that restrict unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, monetization, mining, profiling, training, or derivation of secondary value from preserved Thoughts absent explicit cryptographic authorization from a Control Reference associated with the Custody Bundle.
Custodial systems may further maintain cryptographic audit logs, integrity proofs, and preservation attestations demonstrating correct custody behavior over time. Such audit materials may include, without limitation, storage proofs, access proofs, custody verification records, and cross-custodian consistency checks suitable for evidentiary presentation.
MultiCustodian Redundancy (Optional): In certain embodiments, Custody Bundles are redundantly preserved across a plurality of independent Custodial Authorities. Each Custodial Authority maintains immutable custody of sealed Thoughts while independently verifying cryptographic identifiers, timestamp attestations, and chain references associated with each Custody Bundle. 
Multi-custodian redundancy provides resilience against single-custodian failure, compromise, jurisdictional disruption, or service discontinuity. Cryptographic consistency checks may be performed across Custodial Authorities to confirm that identical Custody Bundles are preserved without divergence, substitution, or omission. 
In exemplary implementations, custody verification records generated by each Custodial Authority may be aggregated, compared, or cross-validated to produce cross-custodian consistency proofs suitable for evidentiary presentation, regulatory compliance, and long-horizon archival assurance.
Selective Disclosure, Verification, and Control Authority: In exemplary embodiments, authors are issued one or more cryptographic control references associated with a Custody Bundle that enable third‑party verification of existence, temporal priority, integrity, and chain continuity without requiring disclosure of the underlying Thought content. Verification is performed by recomputing cryptographic identifiers, validating bound timestamp attestations, and confirming predecessor references using disclosed proofs or derived commitments, without revealing canonicalized content bytes.
Selective disclosure is performed by cryptographically authorizing access to a Custody Bundle, a defined subset of its contents, or specific derived verification materials, while preserving immutability and chain integrity guarantees. Disclosure authorizations may be partial, scope‑limited, time‑bounded, revocable, escrowed, or conditioned on multi‑party approval, and may be implemented using asymmetric keys, capability tokens, threshold signatures, or policy‑based cryptographic controls.
Custodial Authorities are cryptographically restricted from accessing or disclosing Thought content absent a valid control reference, such that disclosure capability is technically constrained by the protocol rather than institutional trust. Control authority further governs continuation of a Thought Chain, delegation of rights, revocation of access, escrow arrangements, succession planning, and enforcement of multi‑signature or rule‑based authorization models, all implemented on a machine‑verifiable basis rather than discretionary human decision‑making.
Succession, Escrow, and LongHorizon Legacy Chains: In certain embodiments, the system supports inheritance, escrow, conditional release, and longhorizon succession of control over Thought Chains through cryptographically enforced control references. Control Authority associated with a Custody Bundle or Thought Chain may be escrowed, timelocked, eventlocked, or conditionally activatable based on protocoldefined criteria, including without limitation lapse of activity, satisfaction of multiparty authorization thresholds, presentation of successor credentials, or expiration of specified temporal conditions.
Succession is implemented as a machineevaluated cryptographic process rather than discretionary human judgment. Escrowed or delegated control references may be split across multiple parties using threshold cryptography, multisignature schemes, or policybased authorization logic, such that no single party can unilaterally assume control absent satisfaction of the defined cryptographic conditions. Upon satisfaction of succession conditions, Control Authority may be transferred to a successor entity while preserving immutability, chain continuity, and custody integrity.
Accordingly, Thought Chains may persist in a sealed but recoverable state across extended time horizons, including decades or generations, enabling preservation of intellectual legacies, research continuity, and evidentiary priority without requiring continuous access, disclosure, or custodial intervention. Succession policies may be expressed as cryptographic rules or governance policies associated with control references.
Deterministic Restoration and Evidentiary Packaging: In certain embodiments, sealed Thoughts are restored from custodial storage in a bitwise‑identical form to the originally sealed canonical byte representation (i.e., the sealed state, not any pre‑canonicalized or unsealed form). Restoration operations are performed only upon presentation of valid Control Authority and include recomputation of cryptographic hash identifiers and verification against stored identifiers, timestamp attestations, and chain references to confirm integrity and authenticity.
Deterministic restoration ensures that any restored instance of a Thought is mathematically identical to the sealed instance, such that verification results are reproducible across systems, custodians, jurisdictions, and points in time. Any deviation in restored content produces a verification failure detectable through hash mismatch or broken chain references.
In exemplary implementations, restored Thoughts and associated verification materials may be assembled into structured evidentiary packages suitable for legal, regulatory, or archival use. Such evidentiary packages may include, without limitation, canonicalized content, cryptographic identifiers, timestamp attestations, predecessor and successor chain proofs, custody verification records, multi‑custodian consistency proofs, anchoring proofs, and human‑readable certificates or seals.
Evidentiary packages may be formatted in jurisdiction‑specific or proceeding‑specific forms while preserving cryptographic verifiability, enabling independent third parties to validate origination, temporal priority, continuity, and integrity without reliance on custodial discretion or institutional trust.
Public or Consortium Ledger Anchoring: In certain embodiments, cryptographic representations of Custody Bundles, including without limitation content hashes, chain identifiers, Merkle roots, or other derived commitments, are anchored to one or more public or consortium‑operated distributed ledgers to provide independent, third‑party temporal verification. Ledger anchoring establishes an external, tamper‑resistant corroboration of the existence and state of a Custody Bundle at or before a given time, without requiring disclosure of the underlying Thought content.
Anchoring operations may be performed for Genesis Thoughts, for successor Thoughts, periodically for batches of Custody Bundles, or according to protocol‑defined policy. In certain implementations, only minimal cryptographic commitments are anchored, such that no expressive content, metadata, or personally identifiable information is revealed on the ledger.
Multiple independent ledgers may be used concurrently or sequentially, including public blockchains, consortium‑operated ledgers, or hybrid ledger infrastructures. Cross‑ledger anchoring improves resilience against ledger failure, censorship, reorganization, or obsolescence by enabling independent verification from multiple sources. Ledger anchoring thus supplements, rather than replaces, trusted timestamp attestations and custodial audit proofs, providing an additional, machine‑verifiable layer of temporal corroboration.

Third-Party Awareness and Signal Recording Without Disclosure: In certain embodiments, the system is configured to enable third-party awareness and response recording with respect to a sealed Thought without disclosing the underlying contents of the Thought.

A Thought may be sealed at a first time, generating canonical bytes and an associated cryptographic identifier. Following sealing, one or more third parties may be provided with limited identifying information associated with the Thought, such as a title, category, abstract, handle, hash, or other non-revealing metadata, while withholding access to the sealed canonical content itself.

In response to such limited information, a third party may generate a response indicating awareness of the existence of the Thought. Responses are recorded by the system as append-only entries associated with (but physically or logically distinct from) the sealed Thought Chain. Each entry may include a timestamp, a responder identifier or pseudonym (including verifiable reputation assertions), a response type, and optional contextual data.

The system may further record the limited scope of information disclosed to the responder at the time the response was generated, thereby establishing that the response was produced without access to the sealed content.
Multimedia Custody, Preview, and Universal Binary Preservation: Thoughts may include multiple media types including, without limitation, images, portable document format (PDF) files, documents, archives, audio files, video files, media files, software code, structured data, sensor outputs, simulation results, computeraided design (CAD) files, and threedimensional model data. The custody bundle preserves mediatype descriptors, canonicalization rules, codec or format identifiers, and integrity metadata sufficient to ensure that heterogeneous binary formats are preserved without normalization loss.
In certain implementations, authorized previews are provided that allow limited human inspection or machine verification (e.g., image thumbnails, audio snippets, video playback, document rendering, or metadata inspection) without transferring custodial control of the underlying sealed binary or exposing the full canonicalized content. Preview generation is performed against derived or transformed representations that do not substitute for, overwrite, or modify the sealed canonical bytes.
Universal binary preservation ensures that arbitrary file formats, including proprietary, obsolete, or futureunknown formats, are preserved in a custodyagnostic manner. Deterministic restoration enables binaryaccurate reconstitution of sealed assets exactly as sealed, independent of codec availability, software versioning, or platform changes, thereby maintaining evidentiary integrity across long time horizons.
Receipts, Certificates, and MachineEngraved Seals: Upon sealing, the system may issue a cryptographic receipt containing at least a hash identifier, timestamp attestation, chain reference, and custody verification reference. The system may generate a humanreadable evidentiary certificate (e.g., PDF) and/or a physical seal (printed, engraved, etched, lasermarked, embossed) containing machinegenerated indicia derived from sealed Thought data. Any alteration of the underlying Thought invalidates the certificate by cryptographic verification failure.
Provenance Classification (Declared Origination Metadata): In certain embodiments, a Genesis Thought or any node within a Thought Chain may be associated with declared provenance metadata indicating an origination classification such as humanoriginated, assisted, mixedorigin, machinegenerated, or unknown. Such provenance classification may be asserted by an originating author at sealing time and cryptographically bound to the Custody Bundle as nonalterable metadata.
The declared provenance classification is preserved for evidentiary clarity, auditability, and downstream interpretation, without requiring enforcement, inspection, or censorship of the underlying creation process. Verification systems may rely on the classification to distinguish human cognitive origination from machinegenerated or hybrid artifacts when evaluating priority, authorship, inventorship, or admissibility, while recognizing that the classification itself reflects an asserted context rather than a determinative judgment by the custodial system.
Implementation Examples and Reduction to Practice (NonLimiting): An exemplary implementation includes a networkaccessible software system comprising client interfaces and serverside processing pipelines configured to perform deterministic canonicalization, cryptographic hashing, timestamp attestation binding, custody bundle creation, immutable storage, chain management, verification, certificate generation, selective disclosure, and deterministic restoration as described herein.
In one nonlimiting example, an author interacts with a webbased or native application executing on a generalpurpose computing device. The application transmits a digital artifact to a processing service that canonicalizes the artifact, computes cryptographic identifiers, obtains one or more trusted timestamp attestations, assembles a custody bundle, and stores the bundle within one or more immutable custodial storage systems. A cryptographic receipt and optional evidentiary certificate are returned to the author.
In another nonlimiting example, a Thought Chain is extended over time by submitting successive artifacts that reference predecessor identifiers. The system enforces appendonly continuity, generates successor custody bundles, and optionally anchors derived cryptographic commitments to one or more public or consortium ledgers. Verification of existence, priority, and continuity may be performed at any time without disclosure of underlying content.
In further nonlimiting examples, the system supports selective disclosure workflows, succession and escrow policies, multicustodian redundancy, jurisdictionspecific evidentiary packaging, and restoration of sealed artifacts in bitwiseidentical form. These examples illustrate practical reduction to practice using conventional computing infrastructure combined with the cryptographic protocols described herein, without limiting the scope of the claimed invention.

	•	Rendering user‑defined labels in user interfaces, evidentiary certificates, receipts, previews, or visualizations to improve human interpretability while maintaining cryptographic verifiability.

17. Mathematical Formalization of Canonicalization, Hashing, and Chaining
In certain embodiments, the cryptographic operations described herein may be expressed formally to illustrate deterministic behavior of the disclosed system, without limiting the scope of the invention to any particular algorithm, cryptographic primitive, or mathematical representation.
Let C_i denote the deterministic canonical byte sequence produced from a submitted Thought T_i by a canonicalization function 𝒦(·), such that:
 C_i = 𝒦(T_i)
wherein the canonicalization function 𝒦 is configured to be invariant under non-semantic differences including, without limitation, formatting variations, encoding differences, metadata ordering, containerization, or platform-specific representation, such that semantically identical artifacts yield identical canonical byte sequences.
Let H(·) denote a secure cryptographic hash function exhibiting collision resistance and an avalanche property. A Genesis Thought identifier ID₀ is computed as:
ID₀ = H(C₀ ∥ TS₀)
wherein TS₀ represents one or more trusted timestamp attestations cryptographically bound to the canonical byte sequence C₀, such that alteration of the canonical bytes or timestamp data invalidates the identifier.
For each successor Thought Tₙ in a Thought Chain, a successor identifier IDₙ is computed by incorporating at least one predecessor reference, for example:
IDₙ = H(Cₙ ∥ IDₙ₋₁ ∥ TSₙ)
wherein IDₙ₋₁ is the identifier of an immediate predecessor Thought and TSₙ is a trusted timestamp attestation associated with the successor Thought Tₙ.
Due to the avalanche property of secure cryptographic hash functions, any bit-level modification to Cₙ₋₁, TSₙ₋₁, or any earlier predecessor propagates forward, thereby invalidating all successor identifiers IDₙ for n > 0. This property enforces append-only continuity and irreversible chronological ordering of Thoughts on a machine-enforced basis.
In embodiments supporting branching, multiple successor identifiers may reference a common predecessor identifier while remaining independently verifiable. Each branch preserves cryptographic lineage to the shared predecessor while allowing independent continuation and evolution of Thought Chains.
All identifiers remain verifiable by recomputation using disclosed canonical bytes, timestamp attestations, and predecessor references, without reliance on custodial discretion or subjective interpretation.
This formalization illustrates, without limitation, how canonicalization, cryptographic hashing, timestamp binding, and chaining collectively enforce determinism, immutability, and continuity of sealed Thoughts across time.

ABSTRACT

Systems, methods, and computer-readable media are disclosed for establishing cryptographically provable origination, custody, and temporal continuity of digital artifacts representing human cognitive events. A submitted digital artifact is deterministically transformed into a canonical byte representation without evaluating or interpreting semantic content, and a cryptographic identifier is generated exhibiting tamper-evident properties. One or more trusted timestamp attestations are cryptographically bound to the identifier, and a custody bundle comprising the canonical data, identifiers, and attestations is immutably preserved under technically enforced access control. Successive artifacts may incorporate predecessor identifiers to form an append-only cryptographic chain evidencing chronological continuity. Cryptographic commitments derived from custody bundles may optionally be anchored to one or more public or consortium ledgers for independent temporal verification without disclosure of underlying content. The disclosed architecture provides a machine-enforced mechanism for establishing verifiable provenance and priority of human-originated digital records in environments containing synthetic or machine-generated bitstreams.
